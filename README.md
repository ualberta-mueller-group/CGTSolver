CGTSolver features:
* A pre-computed database of all reduced game positions with 1~15 empty points.
* Complete simplest equal games are found up to 8 empty points in the database.
* Restricted simplest equal games are found up to 13 empty points in the database.
* Simplification & split.
* Static evaluation.
* Simplest equal game replacement.
* Play-in-the-middle heuristic.
* Zobrist Hashing for sum games.
